# Day 4,5

- What is object oriented programming?
- The 4 fundamental principles of OOP

  - Abstraction
  - Encapsulation
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism

- Oop in Javascript?

  - Prototypes-Object are lined to a prototype object.
  - It's called prototypal inheritacne
  - Delegation

- 3 ways to implement Prototypal inheritance

  - 1. constructure function
  - 2. ES6 classes
  - 3. Object.create()

- Constructor function and new operator

- What happens when you create a constructor function.

  - 1. New {} is created
  - 2. Function is called, this = {}
  - 3. {} linked to prototype
  - 4. function automatically returns {}

- Note : constructor function is only possible for function expression and declaration and not for arrow funtion as arrow function does not have its own return type.
